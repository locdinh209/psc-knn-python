# Description: psc-knn-python
Implement a prototype selection method which is based on clustering (PSC) and apply it in a classification problem using k-NN

# Pileline draft:
This project contains:
1.  PSC - Prototype selection based on Clustering
- Dataset -> PSC -> Subset data 
2.  Target: create subset prototypes of input dataset represent for cluster
- Purpose: reduce cost of computation when classify (next step) and increase accuracy.
3.  k-NN - k-Nearest Neighbours classifier
- Target: can classify new sample by using k-nn Algo
